    <H1>About Me</H1>

    <p>Thanks for taking the time to hear about my coding journey! I'll start with a bit of my previous work histroy. I began working for Pepsi Bottling Ventures in 2010, in my time with PBV I really explored all they had to offer. After a few years in sales and merchandise
        I aquired my class A CDL and began driving a truck. After two years of running a route I decided to pursue a new endeavor and began work with a company called Golden State Foods. I have now been with this company for four years and of that time have spent over three of those years in my current role. I have a total of nine
        years in the feild and developed an urge for a new challenge. After many years of learning about the art of coding, I decided to go all in. I am now embarking with the UNC Coding bootcamp and though challenging, it is a blast learning so many new skill sets. Over the past five to six years i have 
        been fascinated by software development, and have always wanted to learn the ways of a programmer! 
    </p>

    <p>So fast forward to present day and here I am writing the code for my first project! I am beyond excited and trying to soak up every momemnt of the journey.
        I know that in due time with discpline and putting in my ten thousand hours, I plan to be the software developer that I have always aspired to be.
